# Formula-1-Track-Rain-Performance
Based on previous race & weather results for various formula 1 tracks around the world between the 2014 - 2021 seasons to identify which tracks produce faster lap times due to wet weather conditions.

Lap time data was collected from the last 8 seasons, based on similarity between cars (Turbo Hybrid engines)during those years as well as featuring a similar track selection throughout the seasons in order to provide more data points per track.
Average qualifying sessions times were selected for lap times in order to provide controlled individual lap times in an attempt to provide closer analysis of the impact of weather on lap times.
Lap time & weather information was consolidated with a track ID database in order to provide a more organized look at each track. Based on the results there were 6 tracks where there were at least 3 instances of wet weather in the last 8 seasons. 3 instances were chosen in order to remove any potential outlier effects based on any single year's regulations/conditions.

Overall depending on track layout wet weather can have a beneficial effect on race times. Three tracks had a 2%+ decrease to lap times due to the presence of wet weather. One track had 2.3% increase, this can contributed to certain unique features of the Brazilian Grand Prix track layout (i.e. elevation & Long Straights). While one track had a 6.4% decrease, this impact can be due to the large number of corners present in the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Based on the finding Wet weather does have a tangible impact on track times and can impact them based on layout as well as various unique features of each track (altitude).
